Please let your students know that if there is an issue with an order the BEST practice is to email me at landeg@mukilteo.wednet.edu with their First and Last name as well as their order ID, it can be located underneath the date on the receipt they receive after an order is complete, and clearly state the issue with their order so that we can work to get those orders fixed the NEXT day of service. Although we would love for each student to have their orders fulfilled completely the day of ordering, it is just not possible with the current amount of orders we are receiving. Please avoid sending students to the Training Grounds Window to fix an order. Thank you so much for supporting our programs and showing our students grace and patience through this process.
